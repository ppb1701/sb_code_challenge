# code_challenge


Note: The OpenWeatherMap api key is actually in a file that is git ignored.  To run, you will need
a key with access to the daily api call and to add the
owm_api_key.dart which contains:
String apiKey=your_api_key_here;

## Getting Started

This project is a for a job coding challenge.  
The goal is for an app that handles a login, gps position, and  
grabbing a weather forecast.
